# Python_Template_Internships

## Recommendation for programming environment

`anconda`: It is for package managing and creating environments, which are needed in VS Code. Anaconda can be downloaded at `https://www.anaconda.com/download`.

`Python`: You also need to download python from `https://www.python.org/downloads/`

`Visual Studio Code (VS Code)`: VS Code is in my opinion the best environment to programm in different programm languages. You can downloaded it from `https://code.visualstudio.com/download`. The next step is to go to the extensions and search after `franneck94 python dev extension pack` and download it. Next step is to create a folder for your projects. If you do not have `git`, you can download this repo as zip file, put it into your projects folder and unzip it. If you have git, you can open git bash, going with `cd filepath/to/projects_folder` to your projects folder and write `git clone https://github.com/Ben-physics-dotcom/Python_Template_Internships.git` into git bash. It will clone this repo into your projects folder. If you want to upload to your own github account, make sure that the repo in your github has the same name like your project name on your computer. You can add to your repo also a license. I chose for my repos the MIT license. After you got your project, the next step is to open VS Code and choise your project folder. VS Code will ask you, if you trust the authors. You answer with yes, because you are the author. If you DO NOT USE THIS TEMPLATE, the next step would be that you go in VS Code `View -> Command Palette -> Python Config: Generate Python Config Files`. If you USE THIS TEMPLATE, the previous step is not necessary.

## Information about pushing your own project with this template

If you using this template and want to push your project to GitHub, you should read the `.gitignore` file, because the following file types will not pushed:

- *.pdf
- *.jpg
- *.jpeg
- *.svg
- *.png
- *.sdt

The `.gitignore` file has more files that will not pushed on your GitHub project.
